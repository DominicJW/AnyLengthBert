# AnyLengthBert

The file names are quite self explanatory. USe the AnyLengthBert.ipynb for all of these files in one (this is the notebook I used whilst developing the model)

this notebook was used as a base https://colab.research.google.com/github/NadirEM/nlp-notebooks/blob/master/Fine_tune_ALBERT_sentence_pair_classification.ipynb
